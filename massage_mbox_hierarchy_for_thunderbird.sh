## PURPOSE:     Update a Eudora-style directory hierarchy of mailboxes so that
#               it can be placed in Thunderbird's "Local Folders" directory.
#               The hierarchy is updated in-place.

## USAGE:       $0 "Mail Folder"

# -depth        So that we don't rename a directory before processing its children.
# -mindepth 1   So that we ignore the root folder, which is normally the
#               Eudora Mail Folder itself.
# -type d       Only directories
# -print0       Required so that we can deal with directories with spaces
#               in their names
#
#               The pipe to "read" is a trick I picked up on Stack Overflow.
